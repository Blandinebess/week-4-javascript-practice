  <h1>Variables in JavaScript</h1>

  <p>You know all about variables from math class. The are similar in JavaScript, but not exactly the same. In
    JavaScript the = sign means "assignment", not "equal". You have to "declare" and "assign" variables before you use
    them. Some programmers like to declare and assign their variables at the top of their program so they are easy to
    find.
  </p>
  <p>We can use the keyword let the declare our variables, and the operator = to assign them.</p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <script>
    let x;
    let y;
    let z;

    x = 1;
    y = 2;
    z = 1024;
  </script>

  <p>
    After we declare and assign them, we can use them!
  </p>
  <script>
    document.write("I have... ");
    document.write(z * y);
    document.write(" ...coconuts to sell you.");
  </script>

  <p>Let's do some more examples</p>
  <script>
    document.write(" x divided by y is... ");
    document.write(x/y);
  </script>
  <p>
    z divided by y is
    <script>
      document.write(z/y);
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    z plus x divided by y is
    <script>
      document.write((z+x)/y);
    </script>
  </p>
  <h3>You try it!</h3>
  <p>y times z is
    <script>
      document.write(y*z);
    </script>
  </p>
  <p> 16 times z is
    <script>
      document.write(16*z);
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>32 plus z times y is
    <script>
      document.write((32+z)*y);

    </script>
  </p>
  <p>z divided by y is
    <script>
      document.write(z/y);
    </script>
  <p> p times z divided by y is
    <script>
      let p = 5; // Example value for p
      document.write((p * z) / y);
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    the remainder of y divided by x is 
    <script>
      document.write(y % x);
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    356 time d plus z is 
    <script>
      let d =3; // Example value for d
      document.write(356 * d + z)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    96 plus z divided by a is 
    <script>
      let a = 5; // Example value for a
      document.write(96 + z / a)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    2 times z divided by y is 
    <script>
      document.write(2 * z / y)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    y time z divided by x is
    <script>
      document.write(y * z / x)
      </script>
  </p>
    Now do five more of your own using one more more of the variables x, y and z and mathematical operators.
